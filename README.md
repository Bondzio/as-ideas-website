# AS Ideas Home Page

This is our long running homepage project. Although we have some repos with different version of our homepage, this should be the most actual one.

## Setup

This project uses NPM, Yarn, Webpack, React and we assume you are at least a bit familiar with these techbologies. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). If you want to update or edit our webpack config, [check out](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) the readme of create-react-app. Also if you want to understand how CSS styling. images, fonts, test or other things works, see the readme.

Clone the repository, _cd_ yourself into the cloned folder and run:

```bash
yarn install
```

or 

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start a development server with some cool stuff like hot reloading:

```bash
yarn start (or npm run start)
```

## Production Build

To build and minify all assets run:

```bash
yarn build (or npm run build)
```
