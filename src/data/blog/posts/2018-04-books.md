summary: "Some time ago I gave a talk about 15 books in 15 minutes. This is my personal list of must read books for developers. Yes, you will become a better developer by reading them. I even dare to say that at some point you will not become better by only practicing or learning new programming languages. But by reading books about our profession or even about the broader business."
