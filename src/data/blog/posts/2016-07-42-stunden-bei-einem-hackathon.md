summary: "Hey! Iâ€™m Sebastian, a newly member of Hackerstolz and a huge fan of Hackathons. This is a short story about my last Hackathon. It was not your most typical Hackathon, as it was kind of a corporate one about new ideas some business units, but you still will get the idea how a Hackathon works."
