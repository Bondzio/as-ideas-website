summary: "All developers fear one thing: A sales session instead of something useful. I have seen it in the past - a workshop with a vendor masked as technically and for developers. Which in the end was nothing but a sales pitch. You can image what I thought when Axel Springer planned an internal AWS Summit mainly organised by non-techies and directly from AWS. But in the the end we had a good run with our first internal AWS Summit."
