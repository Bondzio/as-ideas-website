How to become a better developer (without coding) #1
====================================================

![](01.jpg)

You want to become a better developer without more coding? You should read some books! Like forever ago I gave a talk about 15 books in 15 minutes. These books will help you (and helped me) to become better at what you love most: Developing software.

They are must read books for developers. Yes, you will become a better developer by reading them. I even dare to say that at some point you will not become better by only practicing or learning new programming languages. But by reading books about our profession or even about the business and psychology.

# #1 The Pragmatic Programmer
### ![the_pragmatic_programmer](The_pragmatic_programmer.jpg)

This one is a classic. It's actually a tie with number two! There are always 10 kinds of people: The Clean Code fans and the Pragmatic Programmers. At my first job we had both and we always discussed these two books. They both adress the basic problem every new developer has: What makes good code? But they have a different approach of teaching you.

The Pragmatic Programmer is the one book you should read as a new member of our profession. It tells you anything you need to know about what makes code good. Or what makes bad code. It even gives you a set of rules to follow! It's quite direct with instructions on what to do and what not to do.

My friend Torsten Ehrhorn even wrote a [Jenkins Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pragprog+Plugin) which gives you quotes and tipps directly out of the book.

# #2 Clean Code
### ![clean_code](clean_code.jpg)

The competitor of the number one spot. Everything I said abouve is also true for Clean Code. I dare to say that the cult about this book is even bigger.

What's the difference to The Pragmatic Programmer? It's the style of teaching: More like anecdotes and little bit more Zen. It tries to give you a understanding why something is good and why something is bad.

# #3 Effective Java
### ![effective_java](effective_java.jpg)

It's written by one of the core developers of the Java library, Joshua Bloch. You don't like Java? You still need to read this book! It tells you a lot about the design of software. And the JDK is not any software, it's huge! Reading this book also teaches you about good code, about design decisions and about the thoughts which flow into the Java core API.

# #4 Java Puzzlers
### ![Bloch_032133678X_mech.qxd](java_puzzlers.jpg)

OK, you can skip this book if you are not a Java developer. It's also from Joshua Bloch. At my first company someone got his hand on this book. And then we good a daily challenge out of it by mail. We loved it! It teaches you so much about Java and some quirky parts of it. Here is an example:

# #5 Head First Design Patterns
### ![head-first-design-patterns-400x400-imaeffnvjhphuguk](head-first-design-patterns-400x400-imaeffnvjhphuguk.jpeg)

The legendary Gang of Four book (GoF) about Design Patterns. A must read everybody recommends! Don't read it. It's boring as hell. Read this one instead.

The examples are in C#, but it has a great layout and explains the different patterns way better.

# #6 Coders At Work
### ![coders_at_work](coders_at_work.jpg)

This book opened my eyes. Before reading this book I thought I knew what makes a great developer. What's right and what is wrong. But after Coders At Work I realised how wrong I was. How single minded. These people are the most renowned ones of our profession. They have an enourmes track record.

And they say totally different things. Like opposite approaches to solving the same problem. You can read one chapter and let the wise words think in. And then the next one with another developer interviewed who says the opposite and it's also wise and true!

Here is the list of the interviews:

* Frances Allen: Pioneer in optimizing compilers, first woman to win the Turing Award (2006) and first female IBM fellow
* Joe Armstrong: Inventor of Erlang
* Joshua Bloch: Author of the Java collections framework, now at Google
* Bernie Cosell: One of the main software guys behind the original ARPANET IMPs and a master debugger
* Douglas Crockford: JSON founder, JavaScript architect at Yahoo!
* L. Peter Deutsch: Author of Ghostscript, implementer of Smalltalk-80 at Xerox PARC and Lisp 1.5 on PDP-1
* Brendan Eich: Inventor of JavaScript, CTO of the Mozilla Corporation
* Brad Fitzpatrick: Writer of LiveJournal, OpenID, memcached, and Perlbal
* Dan Ingalls: Smalltalk implementor and designer
* Simon Peyton Jones: Coinventor of Haskell and lead designer of Glasgow Haskell Compiler
* Donald Knuth: Author of The Art of Computer Programming and creator of TeX
* Peter Norvig: Director of Research at Google and author of the standard text on AI
* Guy Steele: Coinventor of Scheme and part of the Common Lisp Gang of Five, currently working on Fortress
* Ken Thompson: Inventor of UNIX
* Jamie Zawinski: Author of XEmacs and early Netscape/Mozilla hacker

* Scala
* Erlang
* Clojure
* Haskell

# #8 Effective JavaScript</h2>

You don't like JavaScript? Well, try to get used to it. The web runs on JavaScript.

# #9 The Phoenix Project
### ![phoenix-project](phoenix-project.jpg)

Langform: Hier ein kleiner Buchtipp von mir und aus meiner Sicht eines der drei am meisten genannten Bücher des letzten Jahres (zusammen mit Release It! und Mikroservices von Sam Newman) - The Phoenix Project <http://www.amazon.de/The-Phoenix-Project-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592>  . Ich hatte viel Spaß beim Lesen, das Buch hat an vielen Stellen sehr viele verschiedene Emotionen bei mir hervor gerufen. Es ist recht kurz und sehr unterhaltsam. Und das ganze erinnert mich daran, wie ich mir den Start von OCB so vorgestellt habe. Für einige kann dieses Buch sogar die Sicht auf viele Dinge ändern und die Art wie man arbeitet.

Das ganze ist ein Roman, also ziemlich anders als andere IT Bücher.  Es geht um einen Ops-Team-Leiter, der am Anfang zum VP of Operations gemacht wird und sic

# #10 The Art of Readable Code

# #11 The Mythical Man-Month (1975)

> “The Bible of Software Engineering”

* No silver bullet  
* The second-system effect  
* Project estimation  
* Communication  
* Lowering software development costs

# #12 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us
### ![book1](book1.jpg)

* autonomy
* mastery and 
* purpose

# #13: Building Microservices
### ![building_microservices](building_microservices.jpg)

# #14 Release It!
### ![release_it](release_it.jpg)

This book is from 2007, but it got new hype with the DevOps movement. When you read it, you won't believe it's that old. And you will be more paranoid after reading the book, in a positive way. It's full of war stories and things that can (and will) go wrong.

# #15 The Five Dysfunctions of a team  
### ![book2](book2.jpg)

The second book more about psychology.

# ![book2_1](book2_1.gif)

# #13 Extraleben Trilogie
### ![extraleben](extraleben.jpg)

I count this one as one book, even if it is a trilogy.

## Last but not least

I now have a new list #2 with books, so I needed to write down the old list. This was number one of a two part post. Because at some point you won't become better by [Katas](http://codekata.com/), [Code Retreats](http://codekata.com/) and [training](https://www.udemy.com). You will need to broaden your horizont and develop a better understanding of the problem, not of the solution. These books from list #1 only help you at understanding the solution.
